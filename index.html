                3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room
                temperature
              </li>
              <li>
                3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar (I use dark)
              </li>
              <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
              <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>

              <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour spooned and leveled</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch (cornflour)</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>
                3/4 cup (135g) white chocolate chips, plus a few extra for
                garnish
              </li>
              <li>
                1 cup (140g) dried cranberries, plus a few extra for garnish

            In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with paddle
            attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar
            together on medium speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes.
            Beat in the egg and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the
            bowl and beat again as needed to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk
            the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together. On low speed,
            slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough
            will be soft and thick. Add the white chocolate chips and dried
            cranberries and beat on low speed until combined. Cover dough
            tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to
            3-4 days. Chilling is imperative to prevent the cookies from
            over-spreading. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the
            cookie dough chilled longer than 3-4 hours, let it sit at room
            temperature for about 30 minutes. This makes the firm cookie dough
            easier to scoop and roll. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large
            baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set
            aside. As the oven preheats, scoop and roll dough, about 1.5
            Tablespoons of dough each, into balls. The dough may be slightly
            crumbly, but will come together as you work it with your hands.
            Arrange dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
            Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges.
            The centers will still look soft. If cookies didn’t spread much,
            lightly bang the the baking sheets on the counter a couple times
            while the cookies are still warm. They’ll stretch and deflate. Allow
            cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. During this time,
            press extra white chocolate chips and dried cranberries into the
            warm tops. This is optional and only for looks. After 5 minutes,
            transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies stay fresh
            covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
