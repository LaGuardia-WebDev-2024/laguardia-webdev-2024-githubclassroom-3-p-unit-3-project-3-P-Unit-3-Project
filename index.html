            Chicken breast – sliced into cutlets. You literally just slice them
            in half to make them thinner. If you use whole chicken breasts,
            you’ll need to finish this off in the oven to make sure that they’re
            cooked through. But I like cutlets better in this recipe. Flour,
            salt, and pepper – you will dredge the chicken in flour for that
            lovely golden and crispy crust. Olive oil and butter – to brown the
            chicken I use olive oil and butter for flavor. You can even use the
            sundried tomato oil for extra flavor. That’s free flavor there!
            Garlic – because it makes everything taste better! Chicken or
            vegetable stock – I recommend using chicken stock, but if all you
            have available is vegetable stock then that works perfectly fine.
            Heavy cream and parmesan cheese – for a super creamy and flavorful
            sauce. Do not use single or light cream as it won’t thicken the
            sauce very well. Chili flakes, dried oregano, and thyme – for extra
            flavor. Sundried tomatoes – what makes this dish so special! Fresh
            basil leaves – for garnish.

      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Dredge the chicken in seasoned flour, and shake
      off any excess flour. Transfer to a plate but do not stack the chicken as
      they will stick to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2 :</strong>In a heavy-bottomed pan on medium heat, heat the
      oil and melt the butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3 :</strong>Brown the chicken on both sides until it’s golden
      brown, transfer onto a warm plate, cover, and set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Saute the garlic for a minute or until it’s
      fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits
      stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the heavy cream
      and the parmesan cheese to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a
      couple of minutes, then season with chili flakes and oregano.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Season with salt and pepper to your taste, add
      the sundried tomatoes then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the
      sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Marry Me Chicken is now ready! Just garnish with
      chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over pasta or rice.
